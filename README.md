It is the simple TicTacToe game but you cannot win in it. I did not used any traditional algorithm to create the game, I just used the simple strategies and corrected the algorithm by trial and error process.I personally have never beaten it, but If you find any ways to beat it let me know via Github or email me at itsgaurav6817@gmail.com
